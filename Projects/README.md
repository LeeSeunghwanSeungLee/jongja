# Projects

#### DBDR
Deep learning Based Document Recognition is a project that converts documents containing tables into electronic documents(Excel file).  

#### FoodRecommend
It is a project that makes a recommended learning model for restaurants around the universities based on survey.  
This project made based on Python  

#### ICSL_Detector

The ICSL detector is a project that uses Intel PCM's counter to detect cache side-channel attacks used in Meltdown or Spectre that threaten hardware architectures and then allows the detection of three cache side-channel attacks in real-time.  
  
Based on this program, the following paper has been published.
